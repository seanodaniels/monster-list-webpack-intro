# Monster Maker

A way to find out stats for all the monsters contained in the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition SRD.

This was also a project for a Javascript bootcamp, and I used only ES5 basic Webpack stuff.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installing

After downloading the code, run the following:

```
npm install
```

then, in the root directory, run

```
webpack
```

## Running the program

Open index.html in a browser, and make sure you are connected to the internet.
The boxed section should populate with a list of D&D monsters. Just click one,
and the detailed information will appear to the right.

## Built With

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - App packing
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) - Dependency Management
